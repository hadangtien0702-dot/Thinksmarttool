# Changelog & current state

**This is the freshest source of truth.** Read it first every session; update it last every session.
Newest entries on top. Keep it concrete (versions, files, commands).

## Current state (as of 2026-07-14)
- Versions: `app.js?v=18`, `style.css?v=9` (verify against `public/index.html`).
- Last commit on `main`: `e1417be`. Live at `thinksmarttool-gy6f.vercel.app`.
- All 3 tools working: Proposal (AIG/NLG + Khách hàng), Brochure (multi-page grouping, minimal preview),
  Name Card (5 tagged fields, editable, fit-to-viewport zoom, master-protected + copy flow).
- Font embedding on export is live. Design system + light/dark theme live.

## PENDING / open tasks
1. **Name Card icons are low-res raster** → look rough / "mất góc" when zoomed/exported. Confirmed a
   source-asset issue, not a tool bug. Awaiting the owner's choice: re-export from Illustrator with vector
   icons (preferred) OR replace icons with vectors in code. See `tools.md` → "Known limitation".
2. **SF Pro italics + Bodoni Moda** not truly bundled — export aliases them to nearest weight. 100% fidelity
   needs the real font files (or bundle Bodoni Moda from Google Fonts). See `conventions.md` → Fonts.
3. **Two Vercel URLs** (gy6f vs editor-proposesalsale) — consider consolidating/removing one in the dashboard.
4. Future tools the owner may add (platform vision): more sales tools beyond proposals (video, training docs,
   FB post templates, client management…). Keep the structure modular.

## Log
### 2026-07-14 (later)
- **Fixed empty Proposal section on Vercel.** Root cause: `2-Templates/` is gitignored → not deployed →
  `/api/svgs` (Vercel runs server mode) found no proposal masters. Fix in `server.js` `/api/svgs` handler:
  after the workspace scan, also scan `public/templates/*.svg` and add any not already found (dedupe by
  filename), with a synthetic `folder` (`2-Templates/<carrier>` or `Name Card/Chung`) so master-protection +
  carrier grouping still work. Their `path` is `public/templates/<file>` (loads fine via `/api/svgs/content`).
  Also added `public/templates/` to the save-protection prefixes. Commit `6bda21f`. So: **keep the deployed
  proposal copies in `public/templates/` + `manifest.json` in sync with `2-Templates/`** (deploy-vercel.bat
  does the copy) — that's now what the live site serves. Local still uses `2-Templates/` (deduped).

### 2026-07-14
- Created this `thinksmarttool` skill (project knowledge base) under `.claude/skills/thinksmarttool/`.
- Fixed `itemBlock is not defined` crash (missing `const itemBlock` in the agent-fields render). Commit `e1417be`.
- Name Card: removed the "Mẫu gốc" sub-group — masters show directly under the Name Card section.
- Name Card: only 5 tagged fields shown (name/title/phone/fax/email); added `data-nc` tagging + generic fallback.
- Name Card made editable like a proposal (master-protected + "Tạo bản riêng" copy flow); routed via `/api/svgs`.
- Fit-to-viewport zoom fix (`zoomToFit` cap → `MAX_ZOOM`) so small designs open readable, not tiny.
- Brochure: group multi-page image brochures even without a PDF; cleaner preview (dropped filename/type/size).
- Font embedding for JPEG/PDF export. Exports reduced to JPEG + PDF (removed SVG/PNG/copy buttons).
- Established owner workflow: local-first, one commit+push at end of day.

### 2026-07-13 (earlier work, condensed)
- Rebrand to "Thinksmart Tool" across UI + package + server logs.
- Premium SaaS design-system reskin (tokens, Plus Jakarta Sans, light/dark theme toggle).
- Reorganized folders → `1-Design / 2-Templates / 3-Export-PDF / 4-Clients / Brochure / Name Card / _Archive`.
- Left nav restructured into tool sections (Proposal / Brochure / Name Card); clean labels (no folder/ext).
- Right editor panel shows only when a proposal/name-card is open.
- Added Brochure download library (`/api/library`, `/api/download`) + downloaded the real AIG/NLG brochures.
